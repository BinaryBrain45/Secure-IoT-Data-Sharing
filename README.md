# Secure IoT Data Sharing using Proxy Re-Encryption

This repository contains the source code for my final year B.Tech project completed at Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology (affiliated to JNTUH) in 2025.

## Project Goal

The project aimed to address the challenge of securely sharing data between diverse IoT devices while preserving user privacy. It implements a system combining proxy re-encryption (PRE) with blockchain technology and Information-Centric Networking (ICN).

## Key Features

* Allows data owners to grant access permissions without revealing decryption keys.
* Ensures data confidentiality through PRE.
* Guarantees data integrity and access control through a blockchain ledger.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Java
* **Frontend:** Python (using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface)
* **Cloud Storage:** DriveHQ Cloud (used for data storage)
* **Core Concepts:** Blockchain Technology, Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE)

## Conference Paper

This research resulted in a paper titled "Secure IoT Data Sharing using Proxy Re-Encryption" which was accepted and presented at the 4th International Conference on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (ICDSAI 2025).
